# HaoPass -- Password Manager

## Overview

I wrote this software to manage passwords, with all information encrypted. Users can input accounts with details such as username, password, email, PIN, security questions, and other information. They can later retrieve this information by searching for keywords, as well as modify or delete entries as needed.

## Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: All stored information is encrypted for enhanced security.
- **Account Management**: Add accounts with username, password, email, PIN, security questions, and other relevant details.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find stored information by searching for keywords.
- **Modify Entries**: Update existing account details.
- **Delete Entries**: Remove accounts when they are no longer needed.
